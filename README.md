This project allows you to use the capabilities that already exist in your 
browser to securely encrypt and decrypt data. You almost certainly want
to view it on github pages -> https://tomseago.github.io/web-safe

Perhaps this will grow into a larger thing, but for now it is what it is.

It's really a static website. The only reason there is a package.json is
to make it easy to host locally while developing.
